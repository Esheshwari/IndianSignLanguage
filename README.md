# IndianSignLanguage – Real-Time Speech to Indian Sign Language (ISL)

## Project Overview

**IndianSignLanguage** is an accessibility-focused web application that converts real-time spoken language into Indian Sign Language (ISL).

The platform is designed to help Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals understand nearby conversations through:

-  Live speech capture  
-  Real-time speech-to-text conversion  
-  Word-based ISL video matching  
-  Sequential sign playback  

This project is currently built as an MVP and is designed to evolve into a fully AI-powered ISL translation system.
